# Agenix - Secrets (for $HOME)

This directory contains user-specific secrets.
Decrypted with the Agenix home-manager module.

Encrypted with user-specific keys, as these are specific to the user's $HOME folder
and don't need to be accessible to entire system. 

## RClone
RClone config is very sensitive (contains onedrive login info) and thus is not in this repository.
It should be manually copied/ created.
